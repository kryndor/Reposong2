When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
Your date on my data
The chromosomes match
Exact as in matter
A matter of fact
These amorant feelings
A cognitive state
Need the love object
To reciprocate
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
As science struggles onto trial to explain
Oxyoxin's flowing ever into my brain
As science struggles onto trial to explain
Oxytoxin's flowing ever into my brain
A chemical reason
If reason's your game
A chemical needing
Is there in the brain
With preprogrammed meanings
Like a little more pep
Alien feelings
We have accept
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
